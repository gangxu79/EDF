# Java support to EDF files

The repository implements the following package:

``` java
package br.unb.biologiaanimal.edf;
```

which provides an interface with EDF files for the Java programming language, so we can use them in our MATLAB applications. The produced Jar file enables the deconstruction of an EDF file into its header and its records; so the raw records can be directly accessed or translated to ASCII friendly formats.

Although it is already being used, this code is work in progress and shall be used carefully.

Help and ideas are always welcome! `:)`
